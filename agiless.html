          <h5><b>Agile Software Engineering Support Services</b></h5>
          <br/>

          <p>
            Our clients are looking for flexible and agile software development talents who can
             support their organizations through all parts of the software development life cycle
              and who are able to adapt and integrate seamlessly within their teams and enterprise.
              Agile software development addresses software development methodologies focused on the
               principle of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through 
               collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. 

          </p>

          <p>
            Agile approaches emphasize a disciplined project management method that supports frequent
             review and adjustment, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization
              and accountability, engineering best practices intended to allow for rapid delivery of 
              high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs 
              and company goals. 

          </p>

          <p>
            A central tenet in Agile development is that it allows teams to deliver value faster, with
             greater quality and predictability, and flexibility to react to changes. Scrum and Kanban
              are the most established Agile methodologies. An Agile development represents a process 
              that is aligned to the goals of the Agile Manifesto. The Manifesto was established by 14 
              thought leaders in the software industry, and exhibits their experience of what approaches
               do and do not work for software development.
